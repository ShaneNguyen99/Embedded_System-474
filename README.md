# Embedded_System : 474 Final Project
<br />EE 474 from University Of Washington Final Project
<br />In short, we developed a remote music player from the LCD controller to play music on our Android phone. On the LCD controller, we have a list of 5 songs for the user to choose. Once the user chooses a song, the display on the LCD and on the Android phone will show the current songs playing and available options for the user. The user can either pause/resume the song, press “previous” to change to the previous song on the list, press “next” to change to the next song on the list. Also, the user can choose “Home Page” to return to the original song list. 
<br />Here's an image of our LCD display:
